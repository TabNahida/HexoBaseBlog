Ahhhhh! I've written almost 50,000 words for the book [*C++ Unleashed: From Zero to Hero*](/2024/09/26/cpp-unleash/02h-menu)! Even though I used AI and borrowed some from others, the workload is still massive. I have to review it so many times each day, tweaking things here and there. This tutorial is both frustrating and so much fun!

I initially decided to write it in English because I felt that the final result would be better (my Chinese isn't that good). Sure enough, when I tried to translate it, the whole thing almost twisted my brain into knots with the Chinese vocabulary.

Thanks to AI technology (O1's understanding saved me a lot of time), otherwise, writing in English would've been torture. But the sense of accomplishment from this is huge—48k words in three days is pretty impressive!

I've been wanting to write this book [*C++ Unleashed: From Zero to Hero*](/2024/09/26/cpp-unleash/02h-menu) for a long time, and I finally got around to it. I've already realized a lot of my ambitions, and this is the first step in my MCGA (Make C++ Great Again) plan. Onward and upward!

Right now, the book is riddled with bugs, but I'll just have to fix them bit by bit.

To be honest, there are a lot of parts I'm not satisfied with, but it will have to do for now.

**TODO**:

- [ ] Break down the content more carefully by the following lifecycle stages
- [ ] The file system section isn't written well (I initially planned to write about network libraries but didn't want to introduce non-standard libraries)
- [ ] The coroutines section could use some adjustments—my understanding of coroutines isn't deep enough
- [ ] Not beginner-friendly enough?
