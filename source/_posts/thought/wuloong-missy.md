Finally, I've started writing my book, "Miss from Wuloong." I've wanted to write a novel for a long time, but never had the chance. My writing skills aren't great, and I'm a slow writer, which made it really hard to get started. Thanks to the amazing GPT-4 canvas, I finally have ideas and can get some help with the writing process, so my limited literary skills won't hold me back anymore.

Even though I'm using GPT, it still took quite a bit of time. Honestly, GPT isn't quite powerful enough just yet—there are many fixed patterns in the story, and I have to keep adjusting and refining them repeatedly. But despite all that, I've finally started writing, and that feels fantastic. I hope it turns out well, and I'm excited to see where this journey takes me.

Writing has always been a dream of mine, but it felt like an unattainable goal for a long time. I would often think about different story ideas and characters, but I lacked the confidence to put them into words. It’s easy to get discouraged when you compare yourself to professional authors, but I realized that everyone has to start somewhere. The important thing is to just get the words down, no matter how imperfect they are.

With "Miss from Wuloong," I want to bring to life the beauty of Wuloong and the experiences of the characters who live there. It's a story about growth, love, and the challenges that come with change. Wuloong is a place filled with cultural richness and natural beauty, and I hope to capture that in my writing. My protagonist is someone who embodies both strength and vulnerability, and I want readers to connect with her journey on a personal level.

There are so many aspects of writing that I’m learning along the way—plot development, character arcs, pacing, and even just the discipline of writing regularly. Using GPT helps me overcome writer's block and gives me new perspectives on how to approach certain scenes. But it's still up to me to make the final decisions, add my own touch, and make the story uniquely mine. I think that's the most rewarding part: knowing that, in the end, it's my story, shaped by my experiences and imagination.

It’s been a challenging start, but I’m optimistic. I believe that if I keep pushing forward, I can create something meaningful. I’m grateful for this opportunity to finally bring my ideas to life, and I hope that one day others will enjoy reading "Miss from Wuloong" as much as I enjoy writing it.
