## What is AkashaDDNS?

**AkashaDDNS** is an open-source dynamic DNS (DDNS) solution designed to seamlessly link your home network or servers with a consistent domain name, even when the IP address changes. It's built to be lightweight, flexible, and compatible with various environments, ensuring you have an always-up-to-date address for your resources.

In a world where ISP-assigned IP addresses change frequently, AkashaDDNS acts as the glue that keeps your domain pointing to the right place without any hassle. Whether you're hosting a small website at home or managing network services, AkashaDDNS gives you the power of simple DNS management.

## What's New in Version 4.0.2?

Version **v4.0.2** brings some exciting improvements and a cleaner architecture. Here are the key features:

- **Reworked Core Logic**: The core logic has been streamlined and optimized for better performance. We've refactored the architecture to simplify the codebase, making it easier to maintain and extend.
- **Enhanced Reliability**: We've improved the handling of edge cases where IP addresses change frequently, leading to fewer failures and more consistent domain updates.
- **New Configuration Options**: This release also introduces new configuration options to make setup more adaptable, with better default settings for common use cases.
- **User-Friendly CLI**: We’ve refined the command-line interface (CLI) to make it more intuitive. Even beginners can now configure their dynamic DNS with just a few commands.

## Why AkashaDDNS?

We know that there are many DDNS solutions out there, but **AkashaDDNS** stands apart due to its **open-source nature, flexibility**, and focus on **user experience**.
