## Unit Testing Frameworks

### Introduction to Unit Testing

**Unit Testing** is a software testing method where individual units or components of a software are tested in isolation to ensure they function as intended. In C++, unit tests help verify that classes, functions, and modules behave correctly, facilitating early detection of bugs and regressions.

**Benefits of Unit Testing:**
- **Early Bug Detection:** Identifies issues at the component level before integration.
- **Facilitates Refactoring:** Ensures changes don't break existing functionality.
- **Documentation:** Serves as a form of documentation for expected behavior.
- **Improves Design:** Encourages modular and decoupled code structures.

### Google Test Framework

**Google Test** (also known as **gtest**) is a widely used C++ testing framework developed by Google. It offers a rich set of assertions, test fixtures, parameterized tests, and seamless integration with various build systems.

**Key Features:**
- **Assertions:** Provides a comprehensive set of macros for verifying conditions.
- **Test Fixtures:** Allows setup and teardown operations for multiple tests.
- **Parameterized Tests:** Facilitates running the same test logic with different inputs.
- **Death Tests:** Enables testing for scenarios where the program is expected to terminate.

### Setting Up Google Test

**Prerequisites:**
- C++17 or later compiler
- CMake (optional, for build automation)
- `xmake` (since the tutorial focuses on `xmake`)

**Steps to Integrate Google Test with xmake:**

1. **Install Google Test:**
   - Clone the Google Test repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/google/googletest.git
     ```
   - Alternatively, you can use package managers or include it as a submodule.

2. **Configure `xmake.lua`:**
   ```lua
   add_rules("mode.debug", "mode.release")
   
   -- Add the Google Test project
   includes("googletest/xmake.lua")
   
   target("my_app")
       set_kind("binary")
       add_files("src/*.cpp")
       add_deps("gtest")
   
   target("my_tests")
       set_kind("binary")
       add_files("tests/*.cpp")
       add_deps("gtest")
       add_links("gtest_main")
   ```

3. **Build the Project:**
   ```bash
   xmake
   ```

4. **Run Tests:**
   ```bash
   xmake run my_tests
   ```

### Writing Unit Tests with Google Test

**Basic Structure of a Google Test:**
- **Test Case:** A collection of related tests.
- **Test:** An individual test that checks a specific aspect of the code.

**Example: Testing a Simple `add` Function**

```cpp
// src/math.cpp
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

// src/math.h
#pragma once

int add(int a, int b);
```

```cpp
// tests/test_math.cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>
#include "math.h"

// Test case for the add function
TEST(MathTest, AddPositiveNumbers) {
    EXPECT_EQ(add(1, 2), 3);
    EXPECT_EQ(add(10, 20), 30);
}

TEST(MathTest, AddNegativeNumbers) {
    EXPECT_EQ(add(-1, -2), -3);
    EXPECT_EQ(add(-10, -20), -30);
}

TEST(MathTest, AddMixedNumbers) {
    EXPECT_EQ(add(-1, 1), 0);
    EXPECT_EQ(add(-10, 20), 10);
}
```

### Running and Interpreting Tests

After writing your tests, you can build and run them using `xmake`:

```bash
xmake
xmake run my_tests
```

**Sample Output:**
```
[==========] Running 3 tests from 1 test case.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 3 tests from MathTest
[ RUN      ] MathTest.AddPositiveNumbers
[       OK ] MathTest.AddPositiveNumbers (0 ms)
[ RUN      ] MathTest.AddNegativeNumbers
[       OK ] MathTest.AddNegativeNumbers (0 ms)
[ RUN      ] MathTest.AddMixedNumbers
[       OK ] MathTest.AddMixedNumbers (0 ms)
[----------] 3 tests from MathTest (0 ms total)

[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 3 tests from 1 test case ran. (1 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 3 tests.
```

**Understanding the Output:**
- **[ RUN ]**: Indicates the start of a test.
- **[ OK ]**: Indicates the test passed.
- **[ PASSED ]**: Summary of all passed tests.

If a test fails, the output will include details about the expected and actual values, helping you identify and fix issues.

## Test-Driven Development (TDD)

### What is TDD?

**Test-Driven Development (TDD)** is a software development methodology where tests are written before the actual code. The process follows a cycle of writing a failing test, implementing code to pass the test, and then refactoring the code while ensuring all tests continue to pass.

**TDD Cycle:**
1. **Red:** Write a failing test that defines a desired improvement or new function.
2. **Green:** Write the minimal amount of code to make the test pass.
3. **Refactor:** Clean up the code, ensuring it still passes all tests.

### Benefits of TDD

- **Enhanced Code Quality:** Ensures code meets requirements and behaves as expected.
- **Facilitates Refactoring:** Confidence to improve code without breaking functionality.
- **Comprehensive Test Coverage:** Encourages writing tests for all aspects of the code.
- **Documentation:** Tests serve as documentation for how the code is supposed to work.

### TDD Workflow

1. **Identify a Small Functionality:** Choose a small, incremental feature to implement.
2. **Write a Test Case:** Define the expected behavior through a unit test.
3. **Run the Test and See It Fail:** Ensure the test fails, confirming that itâ€™s testing the desired functionality.
4. **Implement the Minimal Code:** Write just enough code to pass the test.
5. **Run the Test and See It Pass:** Verify that the new code satisfies the test.
6. **Refactor the Code:** Improve the code structure and remove any redundancies while ensuring tests still pass.
7. **Repeat:** Continue the cycle for the next piece of functionality.

### Example: Implementing TDD

**Scenario:** Implement a `Calculator` class with an `add` method.

1. **Write a Failing Test:**

```cpp
// tests/test_calculator.cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>
#include "Calculator.h"

TEST(CalculatorTest, AddFunction) {
    Calculator calc;
    EXPECT_EQ(calc.add(2, 3), 5);
}
```

2. **Run the Test and See It Fail:**

```bash
xmake
xmake run my_tests
```

**Output:**
```
[ RUN      ] CalculatorTest.AddFunction
test_calculator.cpp:5: Failure
Expected equality of these values:
  calc.add(2, 3)
    Which is: <some undefined value>
  5
[  FAILED  ] CalculatorTest.AddFunction (0 ms)
...
[  FAILED  ] 1 test, listed below:
[  FAILED  ] CalculatorTest.AddFunction
```

3. **Implement the Minimal Code to Pass the Test:**

```cpp
// src/Calculator.cpp
#include "Calculator.h"

int Calculator::add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

// src/Calculator.h
#pragma once

class Calculator {
public:
    int add(int a, int b);
};
```

4. **Run the Test and See It Pass:**

```bash
xmake
xmake run my_tests
```

**Output:**
```
[ RUN      ] CalculatorTest.AddFunction
[       OK ] CalculatorTest.AddFunction (0 ms)
...
[  PASSED  ] 1 test.
```

5. **Refactor (if necessary):** In this simple example, refactoring might not be needed, but in more complex scenarios, you would clean up the code while ensuring all tests pass.

## Debugging Tools and Techniques

Debugging is an essential skill for any developer. Effective debugging helps identify, isolate, and fix issues in your code, ensuring software reliability and performance.

### Introduction to Debugging

**Debugging** is the process of identifying and resolving bugs or defects in software. It involves analyzing code behavior, inspecting variables, stepping through execution, and understanding program flow to locate the source of issues.

**Common Types of Bugs:**
- **Syntax Errors:** Mistakes in the code that prevent it from compiling.
- **Runtime Errors:** Errors that occur during program execution, such as segmentation faults.
- **Logical Errors:** Flaws in the program logic that lead to incorrect behavior.

### GDB (GNU Debugger)

**GDB** is a powerful debugger for C++ (and other languages) that allows developers to inspect and control the execution of their programs. It provides features like setting breakpoints, stepping through code, examining variables, and more.

#### Installing GDB

- **Ubuntu/Debian:**
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install gdb
  ```

- **macOS (using Homebrew):**
  ```bash
  brew install gdb
  ```

- **Windows:**
  - GDB is typically bundled with GCC (MinGW or Cygwin). Alternatively, you can use **Visual Studio Code** with the **C++ Debugger** extension.

#### Basic GDB Commands

- **Starting GDB:**
  ```bash
  gdb ./my_program
  ```

- **Running the Program:**
  ```gdb
  (gdb) run
  ```

- **Setting Breakpoints:**
  ```gdb
  (gdb) break main
  (gdb) break src/math.cpp:10
  ```

- **Stepping Through Code:**
  - **Step Over:** `next` (executes the next line without entering functions)
  - **Step Into:** `step` (executes the next line and enters functions)
  - **Step Out:** `finish` (executes until the current function returns)

- **Inspecting Variables:**
  ```gdb
  (gdb) print variable_name
  ```

- **Continuing Execution:**
  ```gdb
  (gdb) continue
  ```

- **Exiting GDB:**
  ```gdb
  (gdb) quit
  ```

#### Debugging a C++ Program with GDB

**Example: Debugging a Segmentation Fault**

```cpp
// src/main.cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int* ptr = nullptr;
    std::cout << "Dereferencing ptr: " << *ptr << std::endl; // Causes segmentation fault
    return 0;
}
```

**Steps to Debug:**

1. **Compile with Debug Symbols:**
   ```bash
   xmake f -m debug
   xmake
   ```

2. **Start GDB:**
   ```bash
   gdb ./my_app
   ```

3. **Run the Program:**
   ```gdb
   (gdb) run
   ```

4. **GDB Stops at the Fault:**
   ```
   Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
   0x000000000040113a in main () at src/main.cpp:6
   6       std::cout << "Dereferencing ptr: " << *ptr << std::endl; // Causes segmentation fault
   ```

5. **Inspect Variables:**
   ```gdb
   (gdb) print ptr
   $1 = (int *) 0x0
   ```

6. **Navigate to the Faulting Line:**
   ```gdb
   (gdb) list
   ```

7. **Fix the Code:**
   ```cpp
   // src/main.cpp
   #include <iostream>

   int main() {
       int value = 10;
       int* ptr = &value;
       std::cout << "Dereferencing ptr: " << *ptr << std::endl; // Now safe
       return 0;
   }
   ```

8. **Recompile and Run Tests:**
   ```bash
   xmake clean
   xmake f -m debug
   xmake
   gdb ./my_app
   ```

**Successful Output:**
```
Dereferencing ptr: 10
```

### Valgrind

**Valgrind** is a programming tool for memory debugging, memory leak detection, and profiling. It helps identify memory management issues that can lead to undefined behavior and crashes.

#### Installing Valgrind

- **Ubuntu/Debian:**
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install valgrind
  ```

- **macOS (using Homebrew):**
  ```bash
  brew install valgrind
  ```

#### Detecting Memory Leaks with Valgrind

**Example: Memory Leak Detection**

```cpp
// src/leak.cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int* ptr = new int(10);
    std::cout << "Value: " << *ptr << std::endl;
    // Missing delete statement
    return 0;
}
```

**Steps to Detect Memory Leaks:**

1. **Compile with Debug Symbols:**
   ```bash
   xmake f -m debug
   xmake
   ```

2. **Run Valgrind:**
   ```bash
   valgrind --leak-check=full ./my_app
   ```

**Sample Output:**
```
==12345== Memcheck, a memory error detector
==12345== Command: ./my_app
==12345== 
Value: 10
==12345== 
==12345== HEAP SUMMARY:
==12345==     in use at exit: 4 bytes in 1 blocks
==12345==   total heap usage: 1 allocs, 0 frees, 4 bytes allocated
==12345== 
==12345== 4 bytes in 1 blocks are definitely lost in loss record 1 of 1
==12345==    at 0x4C2BBAF: operator new(unsigned long) (vg_replace_malloc.c:344)
==12345==    by 0x4006A4: main (leak.cpp:5)
==12345== 
==12345== LEAK SUMMARY:
==12345==    definitely lost: 4 bytes in 1 blocks
==12345==    indirectly lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
==12345==      possibly lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
==12345==    still reachable: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
==12345==         suppressed: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
==12345== 
==12345== For counts of detected and suppressed errors, rerun with: -v
==12345== ERROR SUMMARY: 1 errors from 1 contexts (suppressed: 0 from 0)
```

**Explanation:**
- Valgrind reports that 4 bytes were allocated but never freed, indicating a memory leak.
- The stack trace shows where the leak occurred (`main` function at line 5).

3. **Fix the Memory Leak:**

```cpp
// src/leak.cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int* ptr = new int(10);
    std::cout << "Value: " << *ptr << std::endl;
    delete ptr; // Properly release memory
    return 0;
}
```

4. **Re-run Valgrind:**
   ```bash
   valgrind --leak-check=full ./my_app
   ```

**Successful Output:**
```
==12346== HEAP SUMMARY:
==12346==     in use at exit: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
==12346==   total heap usage: 1 allocs, 1 frees, 4 bytes allocated
==12346== 
==12346== All heap blocks were freed -- no leaks are possible
==12346== 
==12346== ERROR SUMMARY: 0 errors from 0 contexts (suppressed: 0 from 0)
```

**Explanation:**
- Valgrind confirms that all allocated memory has been properly freed.

#### Analyzing Valgrind Output

Valgrind provides detailed information about memory usage, including:
- **Memory Leaks:** Blocks of memory that were allocated but never freed.
- **Invalid Memory Accesses:** Attempts to read or write memory that wasn't allocated or has been freed.
- **Use-After-Free Errors:** Accessing memory after it has been freed.

Understanding Valgrind's reports helps in diagnosing and fixing memory-related issues, leading to more stable and efficient applications.

## Profiling and Performance Analysis

Optimizing your C++ applications involves identifying performance bottlenecks and understanding how your code utilizes system resources. Profiling tools help you analyze runtime performance, enabling targeted optimizations.

### Why Profile Your Code?

**Profiling** provides insights into:
- **Execution Time:** Identifying functions or code segments that consume the most time.
- **Memory Usage:** Understanding how memory is allocated and identifying leaks or excessive usage.
- **CPU Utilization:** Monitoring how efficiently your code uses CPU resources.
- **I/O Performance:** Analyzing input/output operations that may slow down your application.

**Benefits:**
- **Informed Optimization:** Focus efforts on areas that yield the most significant performance gains.
- **Resource Management:** Efficiently manage memory and CPU usage to enhance scalability.
- **Enhanced User Experience:** Faster and more responsive applications improve overall user satisfaction.

### Popular Profiling Tools

1. **gprof:** GNU profiling tool that analyzes program performance and identifies hotspots.
2. **Perf:** Linux profiling tool that provides a wide range of performance metrics.
3. **Visual Studio Profiler:** Integrated profiler for Windows-based C++ development in Visual Studio.
4. **Clang Sanitizers:** Tools like AddressSanitizer, ThreadSanitizer for detecting memory and threading issues.
5. **Valgrind (Callgrind):** Profiling tool for analyzing call graphs and cache usage.

### Using gprof for Performance Analysis

**gprof** is a profiling tool that generates a call graph and provides function-level performance metrics.

#### Setting Up gprof

1. **Compile with Profiling Flags:**
   ```bash
   xmake f -m release
   xmake set $(mode.debug) build -pg
   xmake
   ```

2. **Run the Program to Generate Profiling Data:**
   ```bash
   ./my_app
   ```

   This generates a `gmon.out` file containing profiling information.

3. **Analyze Profiling Data with gprof:**
   ```bash
   gprof ./my_app gmon.out > analysis.txt
   ```

4. **View the Analysis:**
   ```bash
   cat analysis.txt
   ```

**Sample Output:**
```
Flat profile:

Each sample counts as 0.01 seconds.
 no time accumulated

... [Additional profiling data] ...
```

**Explanation:**
- The flat profile shows how much time each function consumed.
- The call graph illustrates the relationships and time spent in function calls.

#### Interpreting Profiling Results

- **Hotspots:** Functions with the highest accumulated time are prime candidates for optimization.
- **Call Counts:** Functions called frequently may benefit from optimizations like inlining.
- **Call Graph:** Understand which functions call others and how time is distributed across the call hierarchy.

### Interpreting Profiling Results

Effective interpretation involves identifying patterns and anomalies in the profiling data:

1. **Identify Hotspots:**
   - Look for functions with the highest self-time.
   - Focus optimization efforts where they have the most impact.

2. **Analyze Call Relationships:**
   - Understand how functions interact.
   - Optimize frequently called paths or reduce unnecessary function calls.

3. **Memory Usage Patterns:**
   - Identify excessive memory allocations or leaks.
   - Optimize data structures for better cache locality.

4. **I/O Bottlenecks:**
   - Detect slow input/output operations.
   - Implement buffering or asynchronous I/O to improve performance.

**Example: Optimizing a Hotspot Function**

```cpp
// src/compute.cpp
#include <vector>

// A computationally intensive function
double compute_sum(const std::vector<double>& data) {
    double sum = 0.0;
    for(auto val : data) {
        sum += val;
    }
    return sum;
}
```

**Profiling Result:**
```
Flat profile:

Each sample counts as 0.01 seconds.
  10.00%  compute_sum
  5.00%   main
  85.00%  [other functions]
```

**Optimization Steps:**

1. **Optimize the Loop:**
   ```cpp
   double compute_sum(const std::vector<double>& data) {
       double sum = 0.0;
       for(auto it = data.begin(); it != data.end(); ++it) {
           sum += *it;
       }
       return sum;
   }
   ```

2. **Enable Compiler Optimizations:**
   - Use optimization flags like `-O2` or `-O3` during compilation.
     ```bash
     xmake f -m release -c -O3
     xmake
     ```

3. **Parallelize Computation (if applicable):**
   ```cpp
   #include <vector>
   #include <numeric>
   #include <execution>
   
   double compute_sum(const std::vector<double>& data) {
       return std::reduce(std::execution::par, data.begin(), data.end(), 0.0);
   }
   ```

**Re-Profiling After Optimization:**
- Run `gprof` again to see reduced time in `compute_sum`.
- Verify that overall performance has improved.

- **Extensibility:** Easily integrate custom build rules and plugins.

### Advanced Build Configurations

Customize build configurations to cater to different environments, optimization levels, and feature sets.

**Example: Defining Multiple Build Modes**

```lua
-- xmake.lua
add_rules("mode.debug", "mode.release")

target("my_app")
    set_kind("binary")
    add_files("src/*.cpp")
    set_optimize("fastest") -- Optimizes for speed in release mode
```

**Explanation:**
- **`add_rules`:** Adds predefined build rules for `debug` and `release` modes.
- **`set_optimize`:** Sets optimization levels based on the build mode.

### Managing Dependencies with xmake

Efficient dependency management ensures that your project remains modular and scalable. `xmake` offers integrated support for handling dependencies, including fetching, building, and linking external libraries.

**Example: Adding Google Test as a Dependency**

```lua
-- xmake.lua
add_requires("googletest")

target("my_tests")
    set_kind("binary")
    add_files("tests/*.cpp")
    add_packages("googletest")
    set_links("gtest_main")
```

**Explanation:**
- **`add_requires`:** Specifies external dependencies.
- **`add_packages`:** Links the required packages to the target.
- **`set_links`:** Specifies additional libraries to link against.

### Custom Build Rules and Targets

Define custom build rules and targets to handle specialized build tasks, such as generating code, processing resources, or integrating tools.

**Example: Adding a Custom Code Generation Target**

```lua
-- xmake.lua
target("codegen")
    set_kind("phony") -- Phony target doesn't produce a binary
    on_build(function(target)
        os.exec("python scripts/generate_code.py")
    end)

target("my_app")
    set_kind("binary")
    add_files("src/*.cpp")
    add_deps("codegen") -- Ensure codegen runs before building my_app
```

**Explanation:**
- **Phony Target:** A target that performs actions without producing output files.
- **`on_build`:** Defines a custom build step using a Lua function.
- **Dependency (`add_deps`):** Ensures that the `codegen` target runs before building `my_app`.

### Integrating Testing with xmake

Automate the testing process by integrating test targets within your `xmake` build configuration.

**Example: Defining a Test Target**

```lua
-- xmake.lua
add_requires("googletest")

target("my_tests")
    set_kind("binary")
    add_files("tests/*.cpp")
    add_packages("googletest")
    set_links("gtest_main")
    set_runenvs("RUN_ENV") -- Set environment variables if needed
```

**Running Tests:**
```bash
xmake run my_tests
```

**Explanation:**
- **`set_runenvs`:** Configures environment variables for the test execution.
- **`xmake run`:** Executes the specified target.

## Continuous Integration and Deployment

**Continuous Integration (CI)** and **Continuous Deployment (CD)** are practices that automate the building, testing, and deployment of software, ensuring that code changes are integrated smoothly and deployed reliably.

### What is CI/CD?

- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Automates the process of integrating code changes from multiple contributors into a shared repository, followed by automated builds and tests.
- **Continuous Deployment (CD):** Extends CI by automating the deployment of code to production environments after passing all tests.

**Goals of CI/CD:**
- **Early Detection of Issues:** Identify bugs and integration problems quickly.
- **Automated Testing:** Ensure that code changes don't introduce regressions.
- **Faster Release Cycles:** Accelerate the delivery of new features and fixes.
- **Consistent Deployments:** Reduce human errors in the deployment process.

### Benefits of CI/CD

- **Improved Code Quality:** Automated testing enforces code standards and detects issues early.
- **Enhanced Collaboration:** Facilitates seamless integration of work from multiple developers.
- **Reduced Time to Market:** Accelerates the release of features and updates.
- **Reliable Deployments:** Ensures that deployments are consistent and repeatable.

### Setting Up a CI/CD Pipeline

**Components of a CI/CD Pipeline:**
1. **Source Control Management (SCM):** Repository where code is hosted (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
2. **CI/CD Tools:** Services that automate the build, test, and deployment processes (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins).
3. **Build Servers:** Machines where builds and tests are executed.
4. **Deployment Targets:** Environments where the application is deployed (e.g., staging, production).

#### Choosing a CI/CD Tool

- **GitHub Actions:** Integrated with GitHub repositories, easy to set up workflows.
- **GitLab CI/CD:** Integrated with GitLab, supports extensive customization.
- **Jenkins:** Highly customizable and extensible, suitable for complex pipelines.
- **Travis CI:** Simple configuration, widely used in open-source projects.

**Example:** Using GitHub Actions for CI/CD

1. **Create a Workflow File:**
   - Location: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

   ```yaml
   name: C++ CI

   on:
     push:
       branches: [ main ]
     pull_request:
       branches: [ main ]

   jobs:
     build:

       runs-on: ubuntu-latest

       steps:
       - uses: actions/checkout@v2

       - name: Install Dependencies
         run: sudo apt-get install -y xmake

       - name: Configure
         run: xmake f -m release

       - name: Build
         run: xmake

       - name: Run Tests
         run: xmake run my_tests
   ```

2. **Explanation:**
   - **`on`:** Triggers the workflow on pushes and pull requests to the `main` branch.
   - **`jobs`:** Defines a job named `build`.
   - **`runs-on`:** Specifies the operating system environment.
   - **`steps`:** Sequence of actions:
     - **Checkout Code:** Uses `actions/checkout` to pull the repository code.
     - **Install Dependencies:** Installs `xmake` (adjust as needed).
     - **Configure and Build:** Runs `xmake` commands to configure and build the project.
     - **Run Tests:** Executes the test target.

#### Configuring the Pipeline

Customize the pipeline to suit your project's needs by adding steps for:
- **Static Code Analysis:** Tools like `cppcheck` or `clang-tidy` for code quality checks.
- **Code Coverage:** Measure how much of your code is exercised by tests.
- **Deployment Steps:** Automate the deployment of successful builds to staging or production environments.

**Example: Adding Static Code Analysis to GitHub Actions**

```yaml
- name: Run Cppcheck
  run: sudo apt-get install -y cppcheck && cppcheck src/ tests/
```

### Automating Builds and Tests

Automation ensures that every code change is built and tested consistently, reducing the risk of human errors.

**Example: Automated Testing with Google Test**

As previously discussed, integrate Google Test with `xmake` and include test execution in your CI pipeline to automatically run tests on each commit.

### Deploying Applications

Automate the deployment process to ensure that applications are released reliably and consistently.

**Example: Deploying to GitHub Pages**

```yaml
- name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
  with:
    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    publish_dir: ./docs
```

**Explanation:**
- Uses the `actions-gh-pages` action to deploy the contents of the `./docs` directory to GitHub Pages.

## Practical Examples

To illustrate the concepts discussed, let's explore practical examples that demonstrate how to implement testing, debugging, and building best practices in real-world scenarios.

### Example 1: Writing and Running Google Tests

**Objective:** Implement and execute unit tests for a `Calculator` class using Google Test.

**Steps:**

1. **Define the Calculator Class:**

```cpp
// src/Calculator.h
#pragma once

class Calculator {
public:
    int add(int a, int b);
    int subtract(int a, int b);
};
```

```cpp
// src/Calculator.cpp
#include "Calculator.h"

int Calculator::add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

int Calculator::subtract(int a, int b) {
    return a - b;
}
```

2. **Write Unit Tests:**

```cpp
// tests/test_calculator.cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>
#include "Calculator.h"

TEST(CalculatorTest, AddFunction) {
    Calculator calc;
    EXPECT_EQ(calc.add(2, 3), 5);
    EXPECT_EQ(calc.add(-1, -1), -2);
    EXPECT_EQ(calc.add(-1, 1), 0);
}

TEST(CalculatorTest, SubtractFunction) {
    Calculator calc;
    EXPECT_EQ(calc.subtract(5, 3), 2);
    EXPECT_EQ(calc.subtract(-1, -1), 0);
    EXPECT_EQ(calc.subtract(-1, 1), -2);
}
```

3. **Configure `xmake.lua`:**

```lua
-- xmake.lua
add_rules("mode.debug", "mode.release")
add_requires("googletest")

target("calculator")
    set_kind("static")
    add_files("src/*.cpp")

target("my_tests")
    set_kind("binary")
    add_files("tests/*.cpp")
    add_deps("calculator")
    add_packages("googletest")
    set_links("gtest_main")
```

4. **Build and Run Tests:**

```bash
xmake
xmake run my_tests
```

**Expected Output:**
```
[==========] Running 2 tests from 1 test case.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 2 tests from CalculatorTest
[ RUN      ] CalculatorTest.AddFunction
[       OK ] CalculatorTest.AddFunction (0 ms)
[ RUN      ] CalculatorTest.SubtractFunction
[       OK ] CalculatorTest.SubtractFunction (0 ms)
[----------] 2 tests from CalculatorTest (0 ms total)

[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 2 tests from 1 test case ran. (1 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 2 tests.
```

**Explanation:**
- The `calculator` target builds the `Calculator` class as a static library.
- The `my_tests` target builds and runs the unit tests, linking against Google Test.

### Example 2: Debugging with GDB

**Objective:** Debug a segmentation fault in a C++ program using GDB.

**Code with a Bug:**

```cpp
// src/main.cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int* ptr = nullptr;
    std::cout << "Dereferencing ptr: " << *ptr << std::endl; // Causes segmentation fault
    return 0;
}
```

**Steps to Debug:**

1. **Compile with Debug Symbols:**
   ```bash
   xmake f -m debug
   xmake
   ```

2. **Start GDB:**
   ```bash
   gdb ./my_app
   ```

3. **Set a Breakpoint at `main`:**
   ```gdb
   (gdb) break main
   ```

4. **Run the Program:**
   ```gdb
   (gdb) run
   ```

5. **Step Through the Code:**
   ```gdb
   (gdb) step
   ```

6. **Inspect Variables:**
   ```gdb
   (gdb) print ptr
   $1 = (int *) 0x0
   ```

7. **Identify the Faulting Line and Fix the Bug:**

```cpp
// src/main.cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int value = 10;
    int* ptr = &value;
    std::cout << "Dereferencing ptr: " << *ptr << std::endl; // Safe dereference
    return 0;
}
```

8. **Recompile and Run:**
   ```bash
   xmake clean
   xmake f -m debug
   xmake
   ./my_app
   ```

**Expected Output:**
```
Dereferencing ptr: 10
```

**Explanation:**
- Initially, `ptr` is `nullptr`, causing a segmentation fault.
- Using GDB, you set breakpoints, step through the code, and inspect the `ptr` variable to identify the issue.
- After fixing the bug by initializing `ptr` correctly, the program runs successfully.

### Example 3: Profiling a C++ Application with gprof

**Objective:** Profile a C++ application to identify performance bottlenecks using `gprof`.

**Code to Profile:**

```cpp
// src/main.cpp
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>
#include <iostream>

int compute_sum(const std::vector<int>& data) {
    return std::accumulate(data.begin(), data.end(), 0);
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> numbers(1000000, 1);
    int sum = compute_sum(numbers);
    std::cout << "Sum: " << sum << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

**Steps to Profile:**

1. **Compile with Profiling Flags:**
   ```bash
   xmake f -m release -c -pg
   xmake
   ```

2. **Run the Program to Generate Profiling Data:**
   ```bash
   ./my_app
   ```

   **Output:**
   ```
   Sum: 1000000
   ```

3. **Generate the Profiling Report:**
   ```bash
   gprof ./my_app gmon.out > analysis.txt
   ```

4. **View the Analysis:**
   ```bash
   cat analysis.txt
   ```

**Sample Output:**
```
Flat profile:

Each sample counts as 0.01 seconds.
  50.00%  compute_sum
  30.00%  main
  20.00%  [other functions]

Call graph (excerpts):

index % time    self              calls   self  children    called
                50.00    compute_sum          1    50.00     main         1
                30.00    main                 1    30.00     [unknown]    1
```

**Explanation:**
- The **Flat Profile** shows that `compute_sum` consumes 50% of the execution time, while `main` consumes 30%.
- The **Call Graph** illustrates the relationship between functions and their time consumption.

5. **Optimize the Hotspot (`compute_sum`):**

**Original `compute_sum`:**
```cpp
int compute_sum(const std::vector<int>& data) {
    return std::accumulate(data.begin(), data.end(), 0);
}
```

**Optimized `compute_sum`:**
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>
#include <execution> // C++17 parallel algorithms

int compute_sum(const std::vector<int>& data) {
    return std::reduce(std::execution::par, data.begin(), data.end(), 0);
}
```

**Explanation:**
- **Parallel Reduction:** Uses `std::reduce` with the `std::execution::par` policy to perform parallel accumulation, leveraging multiple CPU cores for faster computation.

6. **Re-Profile After Optimization:**
   ```bash
   xmake clean
   xmake f -m release -c -pg
   xmake
   ./my_app
   gprof ./my_app gmon.out > analysis.txt
   cat analysis.txt
   ```

**Expected Optimized Output:**
```
Flat profile:

Each sample counts as 0.01 seconds.
  30.00%  compute_sum
  40.00%  main
  30.00%  [other functions]

Call graph (excerpts):

index % time    self              calls   self  children    called
                30.00    compute_sum          1    30.00     main         1
                40.00    main                 1    40.00     [unknown]    1
```

**Explanation:**
- The execution time for `compute_sum` has reduced from 50% to 30%, indicating improved performance due to parallelization.
